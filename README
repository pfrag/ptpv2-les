PTPv2-based network load estimation software
==================
- les-0.2.tar.gz: Load Estimation Service implementation (C sources).
- myperf-0.1.tar.gz: Traffic generator capable of generating UDP flows with packets following multimodal distributions (C sources).
- monitor: Scripts for real-time load and delay monitoring (bash, gnuplot)
- les-www: LES HTTP API (php sources).
- serialemu: Tools/instructions on emulating serial communication with a Spectracom SecureSync PTPv2 slave device using existing traces. 
- data-processing: Tools for processing data retrieved from Spectracom SecureSync PTPv2 slave device (python sources).
- evaluation: Tools to train the load estimation algorithm (select appropriate window and smoothing factor values based on measurements).

Requirements
=============
- gcc (plus flex, bison, libpthread)
- python (with scipy, numpy)
- gnuplot
- socat (for serial comm. emulation)
- minicom (for testing serial communication with PTPv2 devices)
- apache with modphp5
