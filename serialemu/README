Emulation of Spectracom SecureSync devices
==========================================
Typically, our LES works on data it receives from a slave device over the serial
port. We can still test the operation of the system even if the devices are not
available. To achieve this, we need to somehow emulate input from a virtual 
serial device. Then, we can configure the LES to read from it just as if it was
connected to a PTP slave.

We use the socat utility for emulating serial communication and a simple python
script which works on already recorded data output. The idea is this:
- Use a trace we've recorded from past measurements
- A python script reads the trace file and outputs 1 line/s to stdout
- We use socat to create a virtual connection between a pts device and the 
output of the python scirpt. For example:

socat -d -d pty,raw,echo=0 "exec:/usr/bin/python ./securesync.py datafile.log,pty,raw,echo=0"

We can test if it works using the minicom utility. 

[Do not forget to edit the LES configuration file to read from the virtual pts
device.]
